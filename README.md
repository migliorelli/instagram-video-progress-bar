# Instagram Video Progress Bar

This extension adds a progress bar (basically toggles on the **video** tag _controls_ property) to all Instagram videos. This includes in-feed posts and reels, the reels page and all other videos.

## Installation

Since I don't want to pay to publish this extension, you will need to clone this repo and use 'Load Unpacked Extension'.
